### Response  
Computer graphics and visualization development with OpenGL has had a significant influence on how I approach designing and developing software. I followed a gradual process, beginning with basic rendering methods before adding complex features like lighting, shading, and user interaction. This project improved my ability to break down intricate visualizations into modular components, making them easier to manage and more efficient. Debugging through visual cues and performance profiling enhanced my rendering pipeline, improving both quality and speed. Additionally, this experience deepened my understanding of GPU programming and real-time rendering, equipping me with skills applicable to game development, simulations, and data visualization. Overall, learning computer graphics has strengthened my problem-solving abilities and will be highly valuable in both my academic and professional journey.
